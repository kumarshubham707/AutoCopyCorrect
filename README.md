# AutoCopyCorrect
Conventionally, copy correction in various schools and colleges is done either by teachers or teacher assistants which is usually a tedious process and sometimes biased.To simplify this tedious task and make the system non-partial, we developed a software in which using OCR, scanned images of students answer sheets will be analysed and matched with model answers using NLP and generate marks accordingly.
